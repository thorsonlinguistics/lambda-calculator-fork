Bug report from Mats Rooth, 2/23/09

directions Steps to reproduce: \\ \\
directions 
directions (i) Start Lambda Calculator \\
directions (ii) Select CP below in the tree and click Evaluate Node Fully \\ \\
directions 
directions This gives an error related to predicate modification, though IFA should apply. \\
directions Now reload the file -- and continue. This time IFA works. \\ \\
directions 
directions [DB]: This is fixed, but the next bug remains. \\ \\
directions 
directions [DB]: Another bug. To reproduce: \\ \\
directions 
directions (i) After reloading, (fully) evaluate the CP
directions (ii) Undo until the CP is fully un-evaluated
directions (iii) (Fully) evaluate again. \\ \\
directions 
directions This throws "do not know how to combine the children" error. \\

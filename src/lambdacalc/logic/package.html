	Provides classes for representing typed predicate logic
	with quantifiers and lambda expressions.
	
	<p>Expr is the base class for all expression objects. Use
	ExpressionParser to parse strings into Expr objects.</p>
	
	<p>Type is the base class for all semantic types (i.e.
	e, t, etc.). Types are associated with constants and
	variables in expressions, and other expressions will
	compute their semantic type automatically.</p>
	
	<p>The IdentifierTyper represents a set of naming conventions
	for constants and variables: which names are constants and
	which are variables, and what are their types. It is used
	when parsing string expressions to associate types with
	identifiers.</p>
